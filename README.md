# Observer based state feedback controller design of a DC servo motor using identified motor model
This repository contains various projects focused on aircraft control systems. The goal is to explore, develop, and implement control strategies used in modern aviation. These projects cover a range of topics, from basic control theory to more advanced systems used in real-world applications.

### Key Features:
*   **Flight Dynamics Simulations:** Simulating aircraft motion and dynamics in different environments.
*   **Control System Design:** Implementation of PID and other control algorithms to stabilize and control aircraft behavior.
